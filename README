🌍 Species Distribution Analysis — Machine Learning for Biodiversity Mapping
Overview

This project explores biodiversity mapping using machine learning techniques, aiming to understand how animal species are distributed across the globe. Working as part of a team of four, our goal is to use data-driven methods to answer key ecological questions that can inform conservation efforts.

The project is part of an MSc Data Science coursework assignment, requiring the application of end-to-end ML workflows — from data exploration and model development to evaluation and reporting — in a realistic research-style setting.

🧠 Project Objective

We aim to analyse and model relationships between species and their geographic locations, using a provided dataset of global animal observations.
Key research questions include:

🐾 Species Distribution: For any given species, where can they be found worldwide?

📍 Habitat Composition: For a given location, what and how many species can be observed?

🔄 Inter-Species Relationships: Does the presence of one species indicate the likely presence of others?

🌱 Habitat Preferences: Do specific species show preferences for certain regions or environmental conditions?

⚙️ Methodology

Our analysis involves the following steps:

Background Research – Reviewing literature and prior approaches to biodiversity modelling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding the dataset, spatial structure, and species distribution patterns.

Model Selection – Applying suitable ML algorithms (e.g., classification, clustering, or probabilistic models) to predict species occurrence or co-occurrence.

Evaluation – Assessing model performance, interpretability, and generalisation.

Reporting – Documenting results, discussing limitations, and suggesting directions for future ecological analysis.

We prioritise methodological rigour, clear explanation, and reproducible code — not necessarily outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

📊 Dataset

The provided dataset encodes geographical locations of animal species observations, pre-processed into training and testing files.
A helper script is included for loading and minimally visualising the data.

Note: Training should only be performed on the designated training data — test data is reserved for final evaluation.
