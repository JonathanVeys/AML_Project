# 🌍 Species Distribution Analysis  
*A Machine Learning Approach to Global Biodiversity Mapping*  

---

## 📘 Overview  
This project explores **biodiversity mapping using machine learning techniques**, aiming to understand how animal species are distributed across the globe.  

Working as part of a team of four MSc Data Science students, our goal is to apply **end-to-end machine learning workflows** — from exploratory analysis to predictive modelling and evaluation — in a realistic, research-driven setting.

---

## 🧠 Objective  
We aim to model and analyse relationships between **species and their geographic locations** using a global dataset of animal observations.  

**Key research questions include:**
- 🐾 *Species Distribution:* For any given species, where can they be found worldwide?  
- 📍 *Habitat Composition:* For a given location, what and how many species can be observed?  
- 🔄 *Inter-Species Relationships:* Does the presence of one species indicate the likely presence of others?  
- 🌱 *Habitat Preferences:* Do specific species show preferences for certain regions or conditions?

## ⚙️ Methodology  
Our analysis follows a complete ML pipeline:

1. **Background Research** – Reviewing literature on biodiversity and species co-occurrence modelling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding spatial distribution patterns and data characteristics.  
3. **Model Development** – Applying appropriate ML algorithms (e.g., classification, clustering, or probabilistic models).  
4. **Evaluation** – Measuring generalisation and interpretability of predictions.  
5. **Reporting** – Discussing findings, limitations, and potential improvements.  

> 🧩 *Our focus is on methodological soundness, clarity, and interpretability rather than outperforming existing benchmarks.*

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset encodes **geographical locations of animal species observations**.  
Pre-processed training and test files are provided, along with a **helper script** for loading and visualising the data.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Training should only be performed on the designated training data.  
> The test data is reserved for final evaluation.
